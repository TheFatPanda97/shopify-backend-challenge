# Overview

This repo contains the source code for the Shopify Summer 2022 [Backend Developer Intern Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z9LZ_kZBUbg-O2MhZVVSqTmvDko5IJWHtuFmIu_Xg1A/edit). I hope you enjoy reading through it ðŸ˜„

# Project Description

This project is a simple CRUD application that allows you to create, read, update, and delete inventory items. The application is built with Express.js and hosted on Heroku with PostgreSQL as the database.

# Project Structure

**Technologies used:**

- node.js (node runtime)
- Express.js (javascript web framework)
- heroku (hosting platform)
- postgreSQL (database)
- html, css, javascript, and bootstrap (frontend)

**Important Folders:**

```
db/
â”œâ”€ seed.sql (seed data for the database)
public (frontend code)/
src/
â”œâ”€ controllers (controllers for each functionality)/
â”œâ”€ routes (api endpoints for each functionality)/
â”œâ”€ utils/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ helpers.js (helper functions for the apps)
â”œâ”€ index.js (api entry point)
```

# Setup

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js v14+
- PostgreSQL

### Steps:

1. clone the repo
2. in your psql terminal, create a new database called `webdb`
3. run the command `sh setup.sh` to create the tables and seed the database. Note: if you are on a windows machine, you will need some extra steps such as setting up [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to run the bash script.
4. run the command `npm run dev` to start the server
5. open the link `localhost:3000` to see the application

# Future Consideration

The application is designed to be very extendable. Currently, the only functionality implemented is `inventory`, but you can easily implement new functionalities by adding controllers and routes to the project.
