# Project Description

This project is a simple CRUD application that allows you to create, read, update, and delete inventory items. The application is built with Express.js and hosted on Heroku with PostgreSQL as the database.

# Setup
Prerequisites:
- Node.js v14+
- PostgreSQL

### Steps:
1. clone the repo
2. in your psql terminal, create a new database called `webdb`
3. run the command `sh setup.sh` to create the tables and seed the database. Note: if you are on a windows machine, you will need some extra steps such as setting up [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to run the bash script.
4. run the command `npm run dev` to start the server
5. open the link `localhost:3000` to see the application
